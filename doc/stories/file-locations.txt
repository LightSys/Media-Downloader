Specify File Locations

As a non-technical church radio broadcaster
I want to specify locations where I find files to broadcast
so that I can get the latest files when they're available.

Satisfaction Criteria:
1. I can specify a location on the server to download from.
2. The location may be a specific path.
3. The location may change based on the date.
4. I can specify what time I believe the file gets updated/uploaded.
5. An error log should kept for failed downloads.
