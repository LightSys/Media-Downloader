Manual Download

As a non-technical church radio broadcaster
I want to download files manually from a remote server
so that I can manipulate them locally.

Satisfaction Criteria:
1. I can connect (and login) to FTP, SFTP, and Dropbox file servers.
2. I can locate the file(s) I'm looking for on the remote server.
3. I can choose where the files should be saved on my local machine.
4. An error log should kept for failed downloads.
