## MoveCute, the Cute File Mover

### TODO:
* FileSync Priority Option
	* FileSyncs could have the capability to specify which file it will select when it matches multiple files. (earliest modified, closest to today, most recent, most recently updated)
 * FileSync Stores and Displays error
	* Error should be added at the FileSync level so users can quickly figure out what went wrong
* Support '/' syntax (unix style)
	* Treat all forward slashes '/' the same way as backslashes '\'
* Use File System Watchers to trigger Auto Sync
	* Add an option to trigger Syncing when a change is detected in the directory that the Source Macro is pointing to
